<p>The man calling himself Torban Lim glanced furtively around the semi-circle of heavily armed soldiers surrounding the caravan. Sweat beaded on his brow, the wind doing nothing against the crushing sun.</p><p>Curiosity getting the better of him, Torban peered at the soldiers. A dozen men- and a few women, he realized with a start; each sat atop a floating mechanical monstrosity. A mass of gears, tubes, and sandy metal plating floating well off the ground. A pale blue light shone from the bottom of the horse size machine. </p><p>"What I would give to get a good look inside one of those," Torban thought, torn between staring at the soldiers and not wanting to give offence. </p><p>The soldiers had first been spotted coming from the East. The caravan, a once lazy procession of guards, merchants, pack animals and wagons; had turned into chaos when it became apparent the rising dustclouds were headed directly for them. Even the caravan leader, a Master Merchant out of Scyter calling himself Kibala, had looked ready to flee before bringing order to the panicking caravan. </p><p>Long black mustaches quivering as much as the rolls of fat on his body, the Master Merchant used a sharp tongue to bring order to the camp. "There's nothing for it," he bristled in a baritone voice, "We wouldn't stand a chance would they want a fight." He made a show of defiance, but Torban saw the signs of unease on the merchant. </p><p>Torban had left with the caravan from Scyter three days ago, bound for Anthem. He had been warned that trade between the city-states was a risky proposition. The truth of those warnings were proven almost immediately.</p><p>The two week journey between the two cities went through a endless flat, cracked expanse known as the Thirsty Sea. Large fissures in the ground made the terrain difficult to traverse at the best of times. Infrequent thunderstorms would turn the ground to mud, sinking a man to the knees. And the fissures were worse, water flash flooding into deadly rivers, threatening to pull even the sturdiest of men into the depths. And as fast as the rivers would come, the land would dry, returning the plain to the arid, desolute drought. </p><p>No thunderstorms had threatened the caravan as it had picked its way through The Thirsty Sea, but the weather was the farthest thing from Torban's mind. Dust clouds had resolved into gleaming shapes in the distance, and then again into men riding those mechanical marvels. Hard terrain meant nothing to the oncomers as they sped towards the caravan several feet off the ground. </p><p>Now they arrayed themselves neatly in front of the caravan. The dust they had kicked up was immediately caught by the wind, blowing away as quickly as it had appeared. For a long moment, that wind was the only sound as the two groups studied each other. Torban was surprised that the machines were totally silent as they hovered.</p><p>The silence stretched, becoming awkward. Caravan guards and minor merchants glancing at Kibala. Dry washing his hands as he stepped forward, the Master Merchant was interrupted before he could speak. </p><p>"What business have you in <i>Dipsalassa</i>?" demanded the foremost soldier in a curt, commanding voice. </p><p>Torban arched an eyebrow, not many knew the Old Tongue, and even fewer would use its name for the Thirsty Sea. Torban studied the soldier, noticing the small differences in armor and machine between the soldier who spoke and his companions. An officer, then.</p><p>Sweat beaded on the Kibala’s brow, not all of it from the oppressive heat. The officer eyed him as the Kibala gestured at the caravan. </p><p>"Ah, g-greetings, noble sir," Kibala stammered, "I am Master Merchant Kibala Anasari, we are but a simple caravan-"</p><p>"From where do you hail?" Demanded the officer. </p><p>"Scyter, m'lord, I-"</p><p>"Scyter? You're either a fool or mad for making the crossing. There's a reason trade has all but stopped." The officer glowered, his voice steel. </p><p>When it was clear the officer expected a response, Kibala gathered himself.&nbsp;</p><p>"Great risk means great reward," he said, defiance creeping into his voice, "Profit is found where others fear to tread." </p><p>Torban had not thought it possible, but the officer's stare seemed to harden even more. He could almost see the scales as the officer weighed the merchant. In a tone indicating he had been found lacking, the officer responded in a flat voice. "Death is found where others fear to tread."</p><p>Any trace of defiance fled from Kibala's face as the officer drew a staff from his vehicle. Two hands wide and an arms length long, with a handhold on the end, it was apparent the staff was a weapon of some sort. The other soldiers produced similar staffs in smooth, practiced efficiency. </p><p>Not willing to see the situation deteriorate any further, Torban strode out from the caravan towards the officer. The officer eyed Torban as he activated the staff in hand. The staff split lengthwise, the bottom side extending out to double the length of the staff. A crackling blue light glittered from the extension. </p><p>Butterflies appeared in Torban's stomach, but he addressed the officer with all the confidence he could muster.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.4em;">"A moment, if you please," before tacking on a delayed "...<i>Officer</i>."</span><br></p><p>The officers’ staff remained at his side, his judging stare now applied to Torban. Taking it as permission to continue, Torban pressed on. "I am Torban Lim, a stranger to these lands, yet even as a stranger I am as shocked as you at the lack of manners my companion has displayed."</p><p>Torban nodded at Kibala, a visage of sweat, shock and indignance. Kibala opened his mouth to speak, but before he could make a sound Torban raised a finger. The merchants mouth snapped shut with such force that his head whipped back. Shock transformed to pain and fear as he stared at Torban, mouth unable to open. </p><p>Torban turned back to the officer, expression now more guarded. The officer peered from Kibala, to Torban, and back again. Torban waited, clasping his hands behind his back in a deliberate show of patience. He watched the officer, seeing the gears turning. Torban had used Power to quiet the merchant, that much was obvious, but it wasn't an especially strong show of force.  </p><p>The troops around the officer sat still as stone, looking to their leader. The twelve of them could surely make short work of the caravan, but someone trained to channel Power could force casualties- depending on how much Power they could draw. Torban knew the math as well as the officer, and gave him nothing. </p><p>The officers staff snapped back to it's original form, crackling blue light subsiding. He did not appear to enjoy the odds. Torban forced himself not to show any sign of relief. It was taking all of him not to double over and retch out of fear. Giving Torban one more measuring look, the officer leaned back.  </p><p>"Stranger, you say," he said as he holstered the staff. "Well then, <i>stranger</i>, by orders of Ezzer Tame, Commander of the Fourth Legion, this caravan is now property of the People and Trust of Anthem. As such, you will be escorted to the Fourth Legion." He eyed Torban, "Unless you wish to challenge this, stranger Torban Lim?" Steel entered his voice at mention of such a challenge. </p><p>Torban looked at the soldiers arrayed in front of him. He had no doubt these troops were willing to die to the man to do their duty. It was his turn to weigh the odds. </p><p>Glancing at Kibala, he was glad he had not loosened the merchants mouth. The self professed <i>Master Merchant's </i>face had gone red, jowls quivering with rage and the strain to speak.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.4em;">Torbun had no desire to see a bloodbath, and he was not particularly strong in the phyiscal magic used on Kibala. He turned back to the officer. "A most gracious offer. We would be most grateful for an escort."</span><br></p><p>The officers face nodded, and Torban wondered if he could see a hint of a smile on the officers sharp, strong face. "How may I call you, officer?" </p><p>"Emin Taber, First of Spears."</p><p>"<i>U'millus ti salutem</i>, Emin Tabir, First of Spears." Torbun said with a slight bow.&nbsp;</p><p>Emin's expression tightened as he responded, "And one thousand greetings upon you, Torban Lim." He recovered quickly, but Torban saw that he had put the officer off balance. It had made sense that a caravan would hire someone who could channel, given the dangers of the journey to Anthem. It did not make sense for that someone to be a noble, or at least from a family wealthy enough for access to a noble education.&nbsp;</p><p>Turning, Emin barked orders at his squad, and at once the caravan was a bustle of activity. As the heavy laden wagons creaked past Torban, Emin gave him one last look.&nbsp;</p><p>"We will speak tonight, Master Lim," the officer stated flatly, "I have many questions."<span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.4em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.4em;">Torban bowed deeply, "And I many answers, Officer Tabir."&nbsp;</span></p><p><i style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.4em;">"And some of them may actually be the truth." </i><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.4em;">He thought as he turned to rejoin the caravan.&nbsp;</span></p>
